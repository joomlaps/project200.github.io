                <p>
                  We took a break to enjoy some tasty food from the nearby
                  stalls, which made the day even better! There were several
                  options, including stalls selling halal (Muslim-friendly) food
                  and snacks, so everyone could find something they liked. We
                  also played museum bingo to enjoy our time at the museum.
